# DSML-Project
DSML Project Code
This the code I wrote for my DSML course. The aim  of the project is to correctly predict the categories of the mobile phones according to their price range (0 to 3).
Linear Regression achieved the best performance of the 11 models I used with accuracy of 0.99 and macro average f measure of 0.99. Suprisingly this was on the rawdata without any feature engineering and feature selection.
